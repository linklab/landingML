rolename.member.desc=Authors make contributions to your journal in terms of important intellectual content. Authors submit a manuscript to your journal and improve their manuscript based on constructive feedback from editorial members and reviewers who have reviewed their manuscript. Authors also provide the final approval of the version to be published.
rolename.manager.desc=Manager provides administrative support to chief editor(s) as well as other editorial members. When a manuscript is submitted to your journal, a manager will look over the manuscript and check that it is suitable for further processing (usually check the formatting requirements).  Manager also puts together a preliminary version for an accepted manuscript and publish it after author\u2019s approval.
rolename.chiefEditor.desc=Chief editor shall be responsible for the oversight of the quality and scope, as well as the operational policies and management facets of your journal. If the submitted manuscript passes a manager's checks and your journal supports associate editors, then the chief editor will identify an associate editor to handle the manuscript's review process, and assign it to him/her. If your journal does not support an associate editor, there can be no associate editor. In this case, the chief editor can coordinate the peer review process unaided. The most important task of the chief editor is to make a decision on whether or not the manuscript should be accepted for the publication, and communicate such a decision to the authors.
rolename.guestEditor.desc=Guest Editor will receive manuscripts for his/her special issue assigned to his/her account. Guest Editors will manage the peer review process for such a manuscript. After gathering enough review results from the selected reviewers, a guest editor makes a decision on whether or not the manuscript should be published to your journal, and communicate such a decision to the authors.
rolename.associateEditor.desc=Associate editor's role is the management of the peer review of manuscripts by members of the peer community. By selecting appropriate reviewers to identify quality manuscripts, and by managing the peer review process efficiently, the quality--and therefore the value--of a publication is increased. After gathering enough review results from the selected reviewers, an associate editor makes a \u201Crecommendation\u201D, not a \u201Cdecision\u201D on whether or not the manuscript should be accepted for the publication. It is the chief editor who makes the decision, not the associate editor, who merely recommends an outcome. If your journal creates a list of sections in terms of research topics, each associate editor manages the peer review process of manuscripts submitted to a section in charge of the associate editor.
rolename.boardMember.desc=Board members are the contributors who will shape and decide the ways as required for your journal's success. Board members' ideas and subject inputs may help in arranging special issues as per topics of your journal. In most cases, board members are enforced to review various manuscripts in their research area.
rolename.reviewer.desc=Peer review is the principal mechanism by which the quality of manuscript is judged. Reviewer should provide written, unbiased feedback in a timely manner on the scholarly merits and the scientific value of the work, together with the documented basis for the reviewer\u2019s opinion. Reviewer can also provide a thoughtful and informative critique of the submitted manuscript to editorial members of your journal.
